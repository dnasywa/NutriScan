## Project Overview
Theme : Food Accessibility, Agribusiness, and Food Security

NutriScan is our initiative to help hydroponic cultivation issues where a proper and consistent level of nutrients is essential for optimal plant growth and yield. As a representative, we choose lettuce as the most common plant. It allows farmers to take corrective action if any indications would affect the plant's quality, whether it is Fully Nutritional Lettuce, Nitrogen Deficiency Lettuce, Phosporus Deficiency Lettuce, or Kalium Deficiency Lettuce using Deep Learning. 

We utlizing color extraction of most frequent RGB as the preprocess and apply CNN along with LTSM layers in our model. By utilizing API connection, in the end we will have an android mobile app application where users can classify lettuce images taken with their device's camera.
